- Worked on multi-task multi-optimisation algorithms for deep learning in PyTorch.
- Integrated different state of the art models/optimizers (DCMF, Eposearch, MGDA, gCMF)  for multi-view heterogeneous data sources from research papers and performed baseline experiments.
- Implemented machine learning models for predictions based on healthcare data (MIMIC 3).
